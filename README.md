# YouTubeCategorize
Using YouTube's API and Python to categorize videos as advertiser-friendly and , as a result, likely or unlikely to be demonetized

Project was initially done by running the dataset through Azure ML.

Planned improvements:
1. Use Python bag of words, naive-bayes, or some other NLP to do text analysis for categorization
2. Scrape subtitles for more text data and a better analysis of the video
3. Make the MonetizationStatus scraper do more than one video at a time and write to CSV.(Please feel free to contact me with suggestions)
4. Optimize for bigger data sets
